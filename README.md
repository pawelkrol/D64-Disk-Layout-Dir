[![CPAN version](https://badge.fury.io/pl/D64-Disk-Layout-Dir.png)](https://metacpan.org/pod/D64::Disk::Layout::Dir)

`D64::Disk::Layout::Dir` provides a helper class for `D64::Disk` module, enabling users to access and manipulate entire directories of D64/D71/D81 disk images in an object oriented way without the hassle of worrying about the meaning of individual bits and bytes describing each sector data on a disk directory track. Handling entire Commodore (D64/D71/D81) disk image directories has been implemented in pure Perl.
